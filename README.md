Friend Finder - Node & Express Servers

Umass Amherest Coding Bootcamp FriendFinder assignment 

Overview

In this activity, I was asked to build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- kind of like a "dating app". I decided to give mine a Game of Thrones theme, and my app has two features. It will let the user submit a form of 10 questions and let them know which Game of Thrones character they best match up to. It also gives them an option of a another survey to match up to other fans. If they fill out the fan based survey the app will store their name and image link for furture searches by other users. This full-stack site takes in results of the users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users(or characters). The app will then display the name and picture of the user(or character) with the best overall match.
